                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>
                    The are.na link with all of my research and sketches is <a href="https://www.are.na/olivia-pasian/index-v5gvflkvsci">here</a>. When I first started working on this project, I had not done a ton of research beforehand and kind of just jumped in. But since I hadn't, I didn't really know what I was doing or what I wanted to do, so I went back and did some research and came out with this research file. One of my biggest inspirations was Sunday Sites, as I saw a lot of cool things on there like usage of mosaic style grids and interesting interactions and colours. My plan was to create a mosaic sort of grid that had links to each of my projects, and I researched some websites that had similar things and found some colour schemes I was interested in. I knew a bit about CSS grids but didn't know a lot about how to add the interactions, and W3 Schools was really helpful to me throughout this project.

                <h2>Sketches/Prototypes</h2>
                <p>
                    The first sketch I made before doing my research was pretty rough, it was just me blocking out how I might be able to make my index. After showing it in class I recieved feedback that inspired the mosaic path I tried to pursue, so I started blocking it out and came up with a layout that would allow me to cover the whole page and have each box be sized to match the size of the project. I also started planning typefaces and colours and decided on something summery and light, lots of blues and yellows, and to use a sans serif clean and light typeface.

                <h2>First Iteration</h2>
                <p>
                  Once I had a plan for my layout, I put it into code. I wanted to have the boxes push against eachother and shrink when not hovered and all be on one page, but I had difficulty figuring out a way to do that and in this draft ended up leaving it at hover to size it up and added a navigation bar instead. It created a fairly disjointed website and while I liked the colours and general style, it wasn't functioning like I wanted it to. I chose the typeface Auster for my headers and Objektiv for body copy and other headers because I thought they were a bit playful and complimented eachother and had the light, summery vibe I was looking for. I really liked the layout and idea behing this iteration but the design was not great.

              <h2>Second Iteration</h2>
              <p>
                I spent a while longer puzzling over my first iteration and trying to figure out the design and movement based on the crituqes I recieved but while I know there is a way to make the dynamic website I wanted to make, I just could not figure it out and I wasn't happy with how it was coming together. I decided to switch directions a bit and keep the summery, dynamic, interactive ideas I wanted but make it a little easier to code by changing the mosaic grid into horizontal lines and based the code off an in-class tutorial we had done. This way I was able to figure out how to open up each section to reveal content a bit easier and kept it all on one page. It still took me a long time to figure out the code but even though it wasn't what I originally wanted, it was pretty neat and was possible within the time constraints and my own coding ability. I kept the typefaces from my first iteration and changed the colour scheme a bit to differentiate between categories a bit more.

                <h2>Final Iteration</h2>
                <p>
                  After the critique of the pervious version of my website, I made some more changes. I changed my header typeface to something a bit more straghtforward as my new goal was something more informational and less summery fun vibes. The new typeface was Fenwick, which still had an interesting structure and worked well with my other typeface but matched my new theme a bit more. I removed the diagonal text, as my idea was that it looked like a binder of files but it just looked a bit odd, so I stuck with titles all to one side. I finished adding the rest of my content and made sure it was responsive to all screen sizes. I also fixed the link issue where it wouldn't open the link because it was closing the section, but that was fixed (thank you for your help!). My new colour scheme was something more neutral, still sectioned by shade but less loud and easier to read. I am overall happy with what I created, I spent a lot of time figuring out the code and I am glad I was able to get it to work. I think while it is a simple design there are some cool interactions and it showcases my work this semester in a fairly engaging but mostly informational way. Thanks for everything this semester, I learned a lot!
